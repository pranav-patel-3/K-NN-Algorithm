# K-nearest-demo

The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a simple machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks. It is a type of instance-based learning or lazy learning, where the model is not explicitly trained, but instead, the algorithm simply memorizes the training data and uses it to make predictions for new data.

This project uses euclidean distance metric to find the closest mobile phone brands with given configuration. 
The choice of the value of k is an important hyperparameter in the algorithm, which can greatly affect the accuracy of the predictions.



k-NN algorithm is a simple and intuitive approach to machine learning, but it may not always be the most effective algorithm for complex or high-dimensional data.
